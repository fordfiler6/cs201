Projects from CS201 - Principles of Software Development
Spring 2014

All code in this repository was completed based on requirements for a class and under strict time requirements.
I did my best to maintain good practice while writing the code, but this had to unfortunately be sacraficed at times in favor of a working product.

In addition, not everything is complete, particularily Lab and Lecture code, which was used as a learning experience and is not intended to be complete or working code.

If you're looking for sample of my work, ClockSpeed was the final 2 assignments for the class.
The first assignment, at it's core, was to create a Monopoly style game.
The second was to network that same game and allow for players to chat with each other.

Other larger scope samples include the Restaurant and Calculator
